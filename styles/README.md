#Bloc Jams#

A Bloc project used to learn frontend web development.

##So isn't not really your creation is it?##

A very good question!  Yes the majority of the code came from Bloc because it was their primary method for teaching. Even so, there is code that I created that's mixed in. And I'm proud of that code.

When I say proud, it's because I am brand spanking new to the frontend and it was an accomplishment just to get something out that worked. One particular piece that I was happy with was the code behind forward and backward track navigation. It uses vanilla JavaScript, loops and conditionals and it does exactly what it needs to, to get through those tracks.
